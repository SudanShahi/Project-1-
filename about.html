        <p>Welcome to my village website — a window into the soul of a place I call home. Nestled in the heart of Nepal, our village is more than just landscapes and traditions; it’s a living story of resilience, warmth, and quiet beauty. I created this page to honor the people who shaped me, the paths I walked as a child, and the culture that continues to inspire me. Every photo, every word, is a tribute to the spirit of our community. Thank you for being part of this journey.</p>
